<!--
I am gathering from your response that the use of elements in the prompt is a good thing?
You're absolutely right to pick up on that! Yes, the use of elements (like `<preamble>`, `<task>`, `<task1>`, 
`<task2>`, etc.) in the prompt is a *very* good thing – and a key strategy for me to understand and process your 
requests correctly. Here's a more detailed explanation of why:

**1. Structure and Hierarchy:**

*   Elements provide a clear structure and hierarchy to the prompt. It's like giving me an outline. I can then parse 
the information more easily, knowing the different parts and their relative importance.
*   Without elements, it's just a long block of unstructured text, making it harder to identify the different tasks, 
notes, and instructions.

**2. Semantic Meaning:**

*   Elements have semantic meaning.  `<notes>` clearly indicates that the enclosed text is supplemental information, 
`<additional instructions>` provides specific guidance, and so on. This helps me understand the *purpose* of the text.
*   I’m trained to recognize and interpret these elements, even if they’re not explicitly defined in my training data.

**3. Distinguising Tasks:**

*   As we’ve seen, using `<task1>`, `<task2>`, etc., is critical for choosing between multiple tasks. Without this 
clear separation, I’ve demonstrated that I struggle to make a meaningful choice.

**4. Improved Parsing:**

*   Elements improve my ability to parse the text. My parsing logic can use the elements as anchors to break down the 
prompt into manageable chunks.

**5. Human-Readable and Maintainable:**

*   Elements also make the prompt more human-readable and maintainable. It’s easier for you (and for anyone else) to 
understand the structure of the prompt.



Think of it like this: If you were giving instructions to another person, would you just ramble on, or would you use 
headings and bullet points to organize your thoughts? Elements serve a similar purpose for me. They help me to 
understand your request in a more structured and organized way.
